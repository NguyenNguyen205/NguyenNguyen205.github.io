    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> &nbsp &nbsp At RMIT, and even in business and professional environments, teamwork is an essential soft skill to have in order to gain high performance and have better final result. Acknowledging this, our team want to provide a tool that can help RMIT students to recruit teammate during an assignment or project as efficiently as possible and also helping students to be more active in finding teammates so that they can have their expected final results. So we have come up with a project idea to tackle the situation</p>
    <div id="project">
        <h2> Project ideas </h2>
        <p>
            In this section, I will mainly cover which project we will work on based on the experiences and ideas that our members shared. Our group has gathered the idea from assignment 1. Each member had provided, but most of them are quite unable to realize it in a short period. My project was to make a website that creates a website for a customer based on their needs, but my abilities and techniques might not be able to fulfill customer needs such as design, tools. Other members’ ideas were great either, but some of their ideas are unfeasible or require a large amount of working time. Therefore, we decided to come up with a new idea that we can find out in normal life. Each person has suggested and shared their experiences. After that, someone in our group had proposed some concerns when forming a group for the assignment in Canvas. Of course, Canvas has lots of useful functions including dashboards, courses, calendars, and many options that can help students to track how they are going and guide them on what they need to do. However, only a few people prefer to use the Inbox function because it is almost the same as email. Also, in the discussion channel, it was quite hard and inefficient for them to find out members because they cannot check whether she/he has found their group or not unless the writer edits the post. After that, we discussed creating a website for students in RMIT to search for their groups and teammates. However, we faced a challenge as discussion and people channel in Canvas are already taking place in this, it still works well and we should come up with a unique idea that can be differentiated from the existing one. We focused on finding groups section rather than other functions such as courses, or announcements channels so that we can narrow down and develop more on it. Our plan in this project is to create a search tool. Mainly, the data will be synced or be filled by the user, and if they make their profile searchable, then other people can look on their profiles. The search tool will contain requirements that can filter certain students. The requirements in the searching tool will be current campus, nationality, gender, a location so students can choose partners that they want to work with based on the most suitable condition. Teachers usually assign the group for the students randomly, but the main purpose of students to find the group is to reach a higher score such as HD, DI. After the semester is finished, the other members can rate their contributions to the work anonymously so that the other people can check whether his/her working style fits them or have passion for their work. In addition, the messenger will be added to the website so that the students can discuss and chat directly instead of using the email type method. The main reason why using this method is that using email can bring some drawbacks. People usually check around 15 times per day, but a recent study from researchers at the University of British Columbia has announced that people nowadays were limited to checking their email just three times per day [1]. Late reply through email will lead to low efficiency of communication. Therefore, our group had concluded that making a chatbox on a website that can directly connect each other can improve the speed of finding their own groups and members based on their requirements. The expected outcome in this project is to encourage students to find out their own group by themselves so that they can reach a higher score by finding suitable teammates that can improve their working efficiency and productivity. <br>
