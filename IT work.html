    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> &nbsp &nbsp In these days, the IT field is a large market with many job opportunities for new comers to join. However, there is still a lot questions regarding about the market, and most of the answers to those we found were vague and didn’t explain a lot. In order to overcome this, we have decided to interview an IT professional to know more about the behind the scenes of the IT works, how it has changed, and what lies ahead in the future. </p>

        <p>
         Kbui: Ok,let’s begin <br>
Kbui: Hi Mr, before we start, please introduce yourself. <br>
Mr Tú:- My name is Vo Van Minh Tu and now I’m currently in charge of the company’s IT system of TTT corporation <br>
-	The size of the company is almost a corporation, with many subsidiaries and has about 1500 employees <br>
-	In which, there are 10 employees of the IT department <br>
Kbui: Ok, I want to ask you<br>
What kind of work is done by the IT professional in your field? <br>
Mr Tu: Well, with the position of IT manager that I’m working on, my working day will also start like other employees<br>
-	The first whing I need to do is check mail, to check if the old jobs are completed or not and the jobs that arise that day.<br>
-	I spend about 1 hour reading the mail and then I will arrange the work to bring the information to the relevant departments, to mobilize the staff below to handle the assigned tasks.<br>
-	After that, I will check all information and services of the system <br>
-	The rest of the time, I will research documents and processes, how to coordinate to improve the work of it as well as related department. And, because my work is to manage so I don’t go into much detail.<br>
Kbui: Thank you for the answer, the next question that I want to ask you is what kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? <br>
Mr Tu: For my working environment, the nearest contact is thought my departmental staff and the department related to my work. I always in contact almost all other department. <br>
guest: The Company works on the IT progress a lot, thus, it will relate to plenty of parts else, <br>
guest: And they all envolve IT from factories to offices and to the constructions.<br>
guest: The “relations” which are being said are by email, phone calls, online chats or meetings such as Zoom, Team.<br>
guest: Mentioning the higher tier, they are the Providers, for instances, the soft/hardware solutions, the supporting-supervisor cooperation….<br>
guest: and the supporting-supervisor cooperation are the other IT services, they perhaps are the keen on solving method, some are the other cooperators of us, we share our new intel about the market or brand-new technologies<br>
MC: Thanks for sharing, and another question which I want to ask is “where, when you usually spend most of your time to work on?”<br>
Guess: Usually, the IT have Flexible working environment and no obligation to sit in one place, unless there are some IT position that involve support and help desk. Then they have to sit at the office to directly help the staff in that office. For example, my corporation have two office and two factory and usually there are an IT department that sit at the office to support directly on fixing any trouble or problem that the customer have. And, some cases they have remote support like support remote down to the factory or to the working site.<br>
-	Or some other position such as the programming department or IT system management department. In reality, they don’t have to sit at work but can work remotely at home or they can sit at a coffee shop because it’s not necessary to work at the office. <br>
-	And because of the flexible working environment, the working time is also very flexible and so they aren’t obligatory to sit from 8.AM to 5.PM except the other position that I have mention above like the help desk position. Because the position require regularly present to which if anyone have a problem they can call in they working time and other position can work with a flexible time and have no obligatory about the time as long as the giving mission or plan is finish on time. <br>
Kbui : Thank you Mr., the next question I want to ask is what aspect of their position is most challenging? <br>
Mr Tu: For me the challenging part of my work is the ability to communicate with other departments to let them know that we are helping them. Because when they come into any problem most of the time they doesn’t know the specialized vocabulary, and because we are the IT professional we will used a lot of the specialized vocabulary to explain to them and sometime they don’t understand and doesn’t share that out a lot. <br>
-	Because of that the challenging thing of an IT professional is went there is a problem we need to help the customer understand the problem they are facing and allow them to share with us the difficulty that they have. Which mean we have to relieve them of anxiety. Because sometimes they can encounter some problem when using the computer or the software isn’t working that will make them worry the file may got lost or not having the computer to work. From that we have to do our best to explain and support them to be able to fix the problem. <br>
-	The next Challenging part is how we behave with another department, we must behave well and did the right thing. We behave well but always stay on our rule. <br>
-	my rule is to keep information and data confidential because sometimes users won't understand the problem. In the VN market, companies in Vietnam often have a problem that they all use crack software and that's a habit since school, it's formed a long time ago. And they default to use it as long as they have it. <br>
But for businesses, I need to make it clear that we will not accept crack software<br>
For those who have such requirements, the solution must be to buy or direct them to use alternative software, for example. And that, we have to explain to them and guide them to use. <br>
If we give another solution, we will have to guide them to use it<br>
Well, that's one of the challenges we have to convince users<br>
And the third difficulty is that our information technology background is very wide, it includes many subjects, from systems to security to standard programming. <br>
and the third difficult point is that our information technology background is very wide, it includes many subjects, from systems to security to standard counting programming. IT is like the medical profession, there are also many different doctors such as dentistry, cosmetology, musculoskeletal, ... a lot of subjects<br>
As an IT, I must have a brief grasp of all subjects, for example, my major is security systems, I must also know the other subjects. <br>
then my IT staff will have to learn more and understand more, not just specialize in any one subject
With companies and large multinational corporations, they will have a very clear job assignment, for example, when I recruit you for the position of "Security Specialist", you only focus on that. In Vietnam, IT staff often hold many positions, in small companies, IT will often do photoshop, marketing, design, printer repair, computer repair, sever maintenance, network maintenance and phone exchange maintenance and many more. While in bigger company the phone exchange maintenance is the work of the team of electricians or telecommunications engineer not IT professional. But in a VietNam company is will all inclusive. Therefore it’s also the challenging thing that the VietNam IT professional have to understand and learn a lot about all the problem they may face. These are the 3 main challenging part that I have summary. <br>
kbui: <br>
And this is my last question for you<br>
As a student majoring in IT<br>
Do you have any advice or useful types for those who are oriented in this major? <br>
Mr. Tu: <br>
Thank you for asking this question, this is a good and practical question<br>
The IT industry is quite attractive to young people today, the job opportunities are quite high, but that is also the reason why you are confused about whether to choose IT. Like I have shared above the third challenging part that is the work of an IT professional will have a lot of subjects. Therefore, you should challenge yourself in many basic subjects. For example, the basic subject that IT have split into two ways: One is about system management, the second is one is about coding which mean that you have to code the software or a website. And you should allow yourself in those two environments from one to two month or half a year to see what fit you the most. And the fastest way to try is to apply for internships in companies that have a strong IT team that have many spots for you to try and from there it will allow you to see the actual work of an IT professional and how the actual work will be like. <br>
Maybe the thing that go thought our mind is like this but in reality, the work in a corporation is totally different. <br>
-	So, firstly is we apply for internships in these company. For example, the first year the main thing that university teach haven’t focus much on IT so you can spend 1 month, 3 month or 6-month internship at a company that have a strong IT team. Like in our corporation, we have a lot of subjects that you can try and see how each of the IT department work daily and find which fit yourself and you can strive for that path. That is how we recognize the right ways for we to go. <br>
-	Secondly, I recommend you attend as much seminar as you can offline or online both works. For now, because of the pandemic, you can’t go to the seminar about the IT major or technology. If possible, you should register free seminar to learn and listen from the professional which allow you to grasp the technique and the trend on how the IT industry is going. <br>
Those are the only two advice that I have. <br>
