    <h1 style="clear: left;"> Introduction </h1>
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp IT is a large area with many subfields, all of which has significant impact on the market and also on our daily life. In this section, we will report on 4 fields of Information Technology that are currently well-known in these days. Those are: Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, AI and Machine Learning, Cybersecurity and Privacy, and Cloud Computing. </p>
    <div id="bc">
        <h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3>
        <p>
        What does is do? <br>
Blockchain is a new decentralized architecture and distributed computing paradigm that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and it has recently piqued the interest of governments, financial institutions, high-tech firms, and capital markets. Decentralization, time-series data, collaborative maintenance, programmability, and security are among the fundamental benefits of blockchain, making it particularly ideal for building a programmable monetary system, financial system, and even the macroscopic social system. We offered a fundamental model of the blockchain system in this article, as well as explored the concepts, technologies, methodologies, and applications of blockchain and the linked Bitcoin systems. We also spoke about smart contracts and their applications, as well as the future trends of blockchain-enabled mirrored societies. The purpose of this work is to provide useful recommendations and a reference for future research endeavors. Also, some of the thing that blockchain can be done now are: Secure sharing of medical data, NFT marketplace like cryptocurrencies which allow people to directly transact with one another without having to trust third party like banks and many more. <br>
The year 2021 will go down in history as a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies. But what comes next? <br>
While Bitcoin’s price has seen several drops since then, its latest new record and current price is an impressive feat considering just a year ago the currency hovered around $15,000 per coin. Ethereum — the next most popular crypto — notched another new all-time high of its own when it went above $4,800 last month (Ryan Haar,2021), as well as increased institutional buy-in from prominent corporations. Based on the Hypebeast article, Ethereum, currently sitting as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, ETH saw an increase of 3.5% earlier today to reach an all-time high of $4,403.93 USD on October, surpassing its previous record of $4,379.62 USD back in May. <br>
Meanwhile, people's interest in cryptocurrency has soared this year, making it a hot issue not just among investors but also in popular culture, owing to everyone from long-time investors like Elon Musk to that kid from your high school on Facebook. We may guess on what value cryptocurrencies will have for investors in the future months and years (and many will), but the truth is that it is still a new and speculative investment with no history to make forecasts on. No of what a particular expert believes or says, no one truly knows. That is why it is critical to only invest what you are willing to lose and to stick to more traditional assets for long-term wealth creation. <br>
Also, the potential of blockchain technology are essentially limitless, and recent advancements have brought us one step closer to a decentralized, trustless internet, transaction transparency, and other benefits. Here are a few examples of how blockchain will affect the future: <br>
-Digital identity: Passwords and authentication questions are now used to prove who we are online. Blockchain has the potential to replace this system with a digital identity that is safe, secure, and simple to administer. <br>
Rather of establishing your identification by recalling some personal, arbitrary piece of information that may be guessed or stolen, your digital identity is based on a uniquely random set of numbers provided to each user on a blockchain network. <br>
This implies that your identity cannot be hacked or modified without access to your private key, making it far more dependable than our existing system. In fact, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is already looking into how blockchain may aid in the protection of digital identities. <br>
-NFTs And Non-Fungible Tokens: In an ever-changing world, cryptocurrencies are one of the most significant use cases for blockchain right now, and it is likely to stay so for some time. However, a more interesting future in blockchain technology is emerging non-fungible tokens (NFTs). <br>
NFTs are a game-changing new way to acquire and trade digital assets that reflect real-world goods. All NFTs are one-of-a-kind and cannot be replaced or swapped; they may only be purchased, sold, traded, or given away by the asset's original owner/creator. <br>
NFTs have the potential to fuel a new generation of digital treasures, ranging from rare artwork to one-of-a-kind footwear and accessories. They might also be employed in video games or other virtual environments to replace goods. <br>
The applications for NFTs are limitless, and these tokens will almost certainly have a huge influence on the future of digital ownership. Furthermore, in the next years, NFTs will most likely be used to purchase everything from artwork to automobiles, said in an article posted by Automotive News Canada. <br>
According to NonFungible.com, sales of NFTs reached $292 million in the previous week. <br>
With NFT sales on the rise, NonFungible has compiled a list of the top five best-selling NFT collections in the last week (Nonfungible,2021). <br>

What is the likely impact? <br>
Blockchain technology has the ability to change all aspects of recordkeeping, including how transactions are originated, processed, approved, recorded, and reported. Back-office functions like as financial reporting and tax preparation may be impacted by changes in company models and procedures. As for cryptocurrency, it offers several benefits to enterprises all around the world. It has made it simpler for enterprises to expand into worldwide markets rather than limiting themselves to domestic markets. This has allowed vendors to build connections and trust with markets that were previously unavailable, which has been excellent for developing countries. Cryptocurrency has not just shaken the banking world. It is also changing the cultural landscape, since blockchain technology has changed conceptions such as ownership. Because data on a blockchain cannot be tampered with, deleted, or faked, people can "possess" a certain set of data. Both of blockchain and cryptocurrency with affected almost everyone based<br>
On the impact that it brings to the world on different jobs and career like: <br>
-Education: Blockchain technology is transforming the storage of certificates and student credentials in educational institutions. With blockchain technology, there is no need for a middleman in certifying degrees, certificates, diplomas, and other academic papers. <br>
How will this affect you? <br>
There are many ways that blockchain and cryptocurrency can affect my daily life. For example, a blockchain is a huge digital ledger that tracks me and my family financial transactions. It may also be used to securely store essential and valuable documents, preventing them from being altered, stolen, or abused. Property deeds, birth and death certificates, financial transactions, insurance records, legal conflicts, and other sensitive documents may be safely recorded and maintained on the blockchain in encrypted code. Also, Blockchain techniques are being used to combat intellectual and creative property theft and fraud, as well as to create proof of ownership, in fields ranging from high-tech patents to fashion and entertainment. Among the blockchain IP use cases are:
,Provenance verification
,Registration
,Tracking of distribution
,Evidence of initial usage in business or trade
,Management of digital rights
,Smart contracts are being used to enforce intellectual property rights.
,Authentication of real-time payment transfer
,Counterfeit products detection
,Recovery of Stolen Property<br>

        <h3>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</h3>
        <p> &nbsp In this session, I’m going to report on one of the most well-known and impactful technology in these days, which is Artificial intelligence and machine learning. This report will contain three parts, which includes the current ability of AI, the impact of AI on the community, and the impact of AI on personal view.
        <br> &nbsp  Before going into details, we will look through some basic terms. First, what is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short, is a field of computer science which involves on how creating efficient model to do specific task that would require a specific code for specific task, like image recognition, playing chess. Machine learning, a sub field of AI, is about creating model and algorithm for computers to learn and make predictions base on the train data.  The ultimate goal of AI and Machine Learning is to create computers that are capable of doing complex task in minimal runtime, such as simulating fluid physics, writing essay, or analyzing the spread of a virus in pandemic.
        <br> &nbsp  Firstly, AI is arguably one of the most used technology. On the market, it is one of the fastest growing fields. Fortune Business Insights (2021) have stated that the AI market has the value of 35.92 Billion USD in 2020, and expecting to hit 360.36 Billion USD by 2028, with investment from both large and small companies and cooperates. Its wide application may also be a contribution factor in growth, from the well-known usage like image recognition, face recognition on smartphones, pattern predicting for recommended videos on tiktok, to the less popular like cancer detection in hospital, generating pictures, or writing full essay from a simple text. The most popular programming language is currently Python (TIOBE 2021), and Python is also one of the most powerful programming language for AI and data model, which could be a factor in contributing to the popularity of AI. Nowadays, AI is popular in used and easy to implement thanks to language like Python and library like Tensorflow. In fact, it is so easy to used compare to the past that the race of using AI in the market really comes down to whoever have better data in both quality and quantity. The more quality data fetch to an AI model, the better the model will become, so companies try to acquire as much data as possible to be the leading company, stated by Ryszard Szopa (2019).
        <br> &nbsp  Thanks to the rapid growth of technology, AI has become more powerful than ever before. In 2016, AlphaGo, a product of Deepmind, has successfully defeated the world champion in the game Go, which is said to be one of the most complicated game ever made. Beside logic and mathematics, Ai can also create art work, like the art “My son and me” created by Artistic style transfer, which base on deep learning (Ryszard Szopa, 2019). This artwork poses a series of controversial and worries among many people in the community. Even the building blocks of AI can now be used by AI, for example, like programming languages. Github has recently release the beta of Copilot, a software that can code with only a few lines of comments. This could revolutionize how software are created, and even well-known IT youtubers like Fireship (2021) think that this could potentially replace developers very soon in the future. This tool is powered by GPT-3, the AI model of OpenAI, which also powers Copilot. It is so powerful that it can recreate an entire essay in just a minutes, with surprising result and hard to differentiate to a human writing, though Will Douglas Heaven (2021) have stated that this model works on the input data and how to arrange it rather than actually being ‘smart’.
        <br> &nbsp It’s hard to predict the future, even in a 3-year time, since technology has become so advanced that it’s hard to predict the next trending topic or where will IT go next. In the fields of AI though, the ultimate goal is to create a general-purpose AI, though it’s still relatively far from achieving that (Russel 2021). This is the kind of AI that can learn any intricate task and master it just as human does or even much better. Although it is unknown to whether we can create this kind of AI, but we can definitely get a more powerful AI than today standard, like writing better paragraph, can simulate physics more realistic, or create a better VR, AR experiences for the users.
        <br> &nbsp  Of course, all of these advancements would not possible without required technologies. And to get AI better, than it is a must that these technologies would also have to be better overtime. As have mentioned before, languages like Python, C++ or library like TensorFlow helps to develop AI, and technology like Big data to help collect data for advancing the model, cloud computing to provide the necessary power to compute all the AI algorithms. All of this has led to the birth of machine learning, or deep learning. And if these fields want to develop further, then personally, I think that all of these tools and technologies must advance with it, or even there could be a birth of entirely new technologies
        <br> &nbsp Secondly, the likely effect on the society will vary, with both good and bad impact. One of the best features about AI is that it will help to reduce repetitive work, improve efficiency of development in rapid time, which will result in the cut of cost and finance, enhance users’ experiences. Jane Collingwood (2021) has written an article on it’s possible to use machine learning to aid in detecting lung cancer in health care, which would result in better prediction and saving time and cost. However, there are concerns with these benefits. One of which is that AI is notoriously known for its unpredictability, which could have fatal real-world consequence if not controlled properly. The Uber car accident, which had led to fatal accident, is just one of many examples for that (Rory 2020).
        <br> &nbsp Another thing that worth mentioning is that it is very easy to trick people to trust something. An experiment in which a cute decorated AI robot can easily pass between people to get into other areas. Imagine what happened if that robot can dangerous computer virus or steal sensitive information without being noticed (Kacie Kinzer 2009). The effect will most likely on every person in the world. Beside mentioned benefits, AI will give rise to automation, which could reduce cost as have said, but may also take away jobs. Not only that, as AI get more advance, it may could replace more advanced job, like landing aircrafts, making prediction in finance, coding complex programs, since at the end, complicated works are just a collection of simple, repetitive tasks, told by Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell (2017).
        <br> &nbsp The impact may vary from person to person, but for me personally, I think that it has already happened without my attention. AI has been used to suggest videos base on my past experiences on YouTube platform. I also used deep learning algorithm in my study, specifically in translating text to Vietnamese and in writing essay to detect minor in grammar and vocabulary. After all, as I get to work in more professional environment in university, the appearance of AI can be more clearly visible to me. All of these tools are generally helpful and have positive impact to my study and my overall daily life. Personally, I think that in the future, I will use even more AI powered tools to not only aid in my study, but also in career as well. This could be an opportunity for me, but I also have some worries if my job will be taken away as a result intricate and powerful AI. But in the end, I don’t think I should worry that much, and rather focusing on what I can do and how would I like to become.
        <br> &nbsp Beside myself, the influence these technologies on my friends and family may well be as significant, or even greater, compare to myself. Majority of my friends already used AI tools like Grammarly, regardless of what major they are in, like logistics, finance, engineer, and so on, with positive reviews and feedbacks about the tools. Even my parents, who are not so interested in technologies or online shopping. However, during the pandemic, when almost everything was moved to online, and thanks to recommended algorithms, they have said that their experiences are much better than they have expected. So in conclusion, whoever a person be or whatever him or her do, AI will always be there, and the impact will just grow larger from time to time, and only time will time if it’s going to be a good idea or not.

        <h3>Cybersecurity and privacy</h3>
        <p> &nbsp In this report, I’m going to discover what actual cybersecurity and privacy are, and their application. Cybersecurity and privacy are becoming important concepts that we need to consider nowadays as people prefer to use devices and IoTs in order to enhance the quality of their lives. The term cyber security refers to the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from cybercrimes [1]. There are lots of types of cybersecurity such as application security, network security, and information security. Application security is to identify the weakness in the application code and fix it to make sure the application works well without any bug or crash. Network security is to keep the network safe from unauthorized access by controlling firewalls, VPNs, or complex identification that can reduce cybercrime. Information security is protection that keeps data safe from unauthorized access or manipulation in the transmission process between machines. The term privacy refers to the right of the user's information to be controlled or observed by third parties.
        <br> &nbsp Privacy in Information Technology is the right to have some control over how our personal information is collected and used [2]. This means that we can control our personal data and anyone cannot access to it without the user’s consent. However, this ambiguous to distinguish whether a certain action violates someone’s privacy or not, and this concern is becoming a social-ethical issue within society. As we are using more and more devices that are connected to the internet, the proportion of devices taking a huge role in our lives is increasing. Lots of cybercrimes occur in this situation as people are not aware of the security and they easily expose their personal information so that anonymous people might manipulate the user's data or observe their life pattern in this process. Besides, Identity theft is now the fastest growing crime in America which people regardless of age, gender, race can be the target of cybercrime [3]. In society, cybersecurity and privacy can be used as a tool of a decision whether it is ethical or legal. People can look for whether their data is stored in a safe without anyone’s access, or whether the programs, network, applications work well without any crashes or bugs. The most effective inventions that let people know about cybersecurity and privacy are the internet and IoTs.
        <br> &nbsp By using the internet, people can benefit from synced data through all devices that can provide convenience. Besides, the user can control the devices even though they are not at home by using programs that can control connected devices through the internet that can save lots of resources, or they can utilize it more effectively such as turning the light on when they arrive at home. Furthermore, IoTs devices not only connect to the internet and interact with the user, but also collect the data and analyze it which is the use of machine learning. Based on the data collected, devices including IoTs will decide for a user that can be used in many ways such as medical diagnosis, and image recognition which resembles what human does.
        <br> &nbsp Cybersecurity and privacy can be considered abstract concepts, but these ideas potentially affected people in both good and bad ways. These concepts enabled people to be aware of what internet privacy is and what they need to do in order to keep their data safe which can prevent cybercrime and data leaks. However, as people prefer to keep the information or any property safe, it might require additional authentication while in progress which will decrease the productivity in the data transferring process. Nowadays, these topics have created some jobs related to security and privacy. For example, in Vietnam, there is a job called Cyber Security Manager that performs technical security assessments and attack simulations on multiple application platforms [4]. In addition, there is a data privacy manager that trains the staff about security policies, contracts with third-party programs to make sure it is trustworthy and secure [5]. As many jobs are being created nowadays, most of the employees that work on computers will be largely affected. In our lives, there are some ethical problems whether the boss of the company can monitor what employees are doing. This can be both right and wrong as employers should know what employees are doing. This doesn’t sound wrong, but on the other hand, employees might feel they are being observed and controlled by employers and their working performances will be decreased. We cannot say who is right and wrong, so these types of social-ethical problems are occurring in our society as the working condition is developing and people are starting to use devices that are connected to each other.
        <br> &nbsp Based on my experience, the terms cybersecurity and privacy inspired me to look around and see how I deal with the devices and control my data. In my home country, our family used IP cameras for observing pets, and to protect a house from thieves. Also, there was a plug that connected to the internet so if I want to turn on the TV for my pet, then I easily click the button in the application and turn on the TV without pressing the button on the remote controller at home. This helped me to think about what action I need to take to protect my IoT devices because if someone accesses my IP camera, then a terrible situation will occur in which the privacy of all families is exposed through it that nobody wants. Even though actions such as not to use the same password on many different websites and trying not to open emails from strangers or not to click any suspicious links to prevent any unauthorized access are small, they will hugely protect us from cybercrime. Usually, our parents are not don’t know which link to click, or they prefer to use the same password to easily memorize. However, after I realize that what would happen if our devices were controlled by other people or information is stolen, so I suggest they not do that to prevent cybercrime.
        </p>

    <div id="clc">
        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p> In this report, I’m going to write about an IT technology called cloud computing. Cloud computing has been around for a decent amount of time, enough for people to see its potential and influence on the IT industry as well as other fields. So far, it has done a lot for us in terms of increasing the convenience in accessing resources, reducing the budget, providing storage and much more. However, there is still room for further development, so I expect a bright future for this technology due to its impact on our lives. <br>
Cloud computing is a technology which offers multiple IT services hosted in the cloud as the name suggest. More specifically, “cloud computing is a method of providing shared computing resources, including applications, computing, storage, networking, development, and deployment platforms as well as business processes. Cloud computing makes computing resources easier to use by providing standardization and automation.” (Judith S. Hurwitz and Daniel Kirsch 2020, p. 8). This means that the technology can be made useful in multiple contexts as long as it is computer-related work. For consumers, cloud computing provides 3 main services model, which are software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). SaaS provides a completed software with user interface while PaaS is for developers, so it provides the developer tools, environment and systems so that they can test and create the application. IaaS is also made for developers, but it is much more advanced compared to the other two. Kris Jamsa (2012, p. 7) defined that “The infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model provides a virtual data center within the cloud. IaaS provides servers (physical and virtualized), cloud-based data storage, and more. Within an IaaS solution, developers must install their own operating system, database management software, and support software.”. Thanks to the variety of services and benefits, many people and corporation are using cloud computing for their own purposes. There are many examples regarding the diversity in the application of cloud computing. Some of the most common uses of cloud computing are hybrid cloud, test and development, Big Data analytics, cloud storage, disaster recovery and finally data backup. Hybrid cloud “is a computing environment that connects a company’s on-premises private cloud services and third-party public cloud into a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization’s applications and workloads. This unique mix of public and private cloud resources provides an organization the luxury of selecting optimal cloud for each application or workload and moving workloads freely between the two clouds as circumstances change. Technical and business objectives are fulfilled more effectively and cost-efficiently than could be with public or private cloud alone.” (IBM Cloud Team 2020, para. 4). Another favourite use of cloud computing is Big Data analytics, for businesses to take a deeper look into their customers to make better products, “Retailers and suppliers are now extracting information derived from consumers’ buying patterns to target their advertising and marketing campaigns to a particular segment of the population. Social networking platforms are now providing the basis for analytics on behavioral patterns that organizations are using to derive meaningful information.” (IBM Cloud Team 2020, para. 9). Next is the cloud storage, a very popular use of cloud computing. Cloud computing “offer you the possibility of storing your files and accessing, storing, and retrieving them from any web-enabled interface. The web services interfaces are usually simple. At any time and place, you have high availability, speed, scalability, and security for your environment. In this scenario, organizations are only paying for the amount of cloud storage they are actually consuming, and do so without the worries of overseeing the daily maintenance of the storage infrastructure.” (IBM Cloud Team, para. 11). In the future, probably within the next three years, cloud computing can be used parallel with fog computing. Cloud computing has many strengths, however it comes with certain weaknesses, such as low responsiveness, low security, limited mobility and so on. Fog computing, however, “extends the Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network, thus enabling a new breed of applications and services” (Bonomi et al.2012 p. 1). It can support cloud computing’s weak spot by offering traits such as high responsive time, high security and high mobility. <br>
Along with the robust development of cloud computing, many things will be affected, most of them will be businesses and data related jobs. With its resources, cloud computing is powering computing activities by providing users with storage without having to own additional hardware for that purpose. Therefore, people can do they job more efficiently and not have to worry about installing extra memory in the long run. Moreover, for businesses, before cloud computing appears, companies have to put a great amount of effort into physical servers. Specifically, companies have to worry about wasting financial resources on servers they will not use as well as the maintenance of servers in operation. But now, with cloud computing, companies have the freedom to only pay for the cloud capacity when they need them, and adjust the capacity according to their demand, which allows businesses to scale easily. Also, cloud computing provides automation, which is useful for companies as they can focus more on their agenda and leave the maintenance to the cloud provider. For developers, this technology opens a new door to test and build larger projects with less time. As it provides applications, servers, and storage with significant amount, Big Data analysis and artificial intelligence are going to be significantly more powerful. Hence, data related jobs and businesses are going to make a big leap in terms of efficiency, demand and profit. With this direction, we may see a future where the cloud would absolutely replace all physical servers, and most of our activities will be more agile by using cloud-based services integrated with other existing technologies. However, this development of technology would likely reduce the need for the installation and maintenance of physical servers and hardware for memory. Therefore, computer storage devices and servers’ maintainers and producers are on the verge of unemployment in the future. <br>
As for myself, I am not using cloud computing right now. However, in the future I would love to work as a data scientist. Therefore, I would like to get used to the work environment by practicing working with big datasets and getting access to online resources as I need them. So, cloud computing would assist me significantly on my way to my dream job. As for one of my relatives, my uncle who is an artificial intelligence engineer, he has been using cloud computing for work, more specifically for data storage and managing his training models. Since using this technology, his job has been more convenience and easier in terms of increasing productivity and delivering products for customers.
